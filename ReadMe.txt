Image Resizer

Just run it in the folder with images, and it will create new folder with smaller, resized images.
Example:


C:\SergeImageResizer.exe
^^^ 1024 size by default


C:\SergeImageResizer.exe 800
^^^ 800 size

C:\SergeImageResizer.exe 800 ovrerride
^^^ override images in the same folder, not reccomended. 


Thank you,
